 ### Hey! 👋 I'm Yarden, a Software Developer.
---

### 💡About Me
- Backend developer by background, but always open to contributing to frontend and exploring new territories in general.
- Passionate about making things cleaner and accessible. I thrive on the excitement of seeing well-crafted project components seamlessly come together into a winning whole.
- Explored technologies like Docker, SQL, and OAuth2 – not a pro (yet!), but I enjoy the journey of learning and experimenting.
- Enthusiastic about projects that break barriers and open doors for a wider audience.

### 📚 Currently Learning
- React is my latest journey.
- Exploring the magic of OpenAI's GPT and had a blast combining it with LangChain – talk to me about GPT, and you might get stuck in a conversation loop.
- Feel free to share interesting technologies, GitHub projects, courses, or videos you think I might find intriguing.

### 🌍 Beyond the Code
- Love tuning into podcasts for new ideas, stories, fun facts, and the latest information. Always open to podcast recommendations!
- Enjoy travel and exploring the world, inspired by the small details that enrich the experience.

### 🌐  Let's Connect!
